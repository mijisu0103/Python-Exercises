    "In cryptography, a Caesar cipher is a very simple encryption techniques in which each letter in the plain text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his generals. ROT-13 (\"rotate by 13 places\") is a widely used example of a Caesar cipher where the shift is 13. In Python, the key for ROT-13 may be represented by means of the following dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "key = {'a':'n', 'b':'o', 'c':'p', 'd':'q', 'e':'r', 'f':'s', 'g':'t', 'h':'u', \n",
    "       'i':'v', 'j':'w', 'k':'x', 'l':'y', 'm':'z', 'n':'a', 'o':'b', 'p':'c', \n",
    "       'q':'d', 'r':'e', 's':'f', 't':'g', 'u':'h', 'v':'i', 'w':'j', 'x':'k',\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task in this exercise is to implement an encoder/decoder of ROT-13. Once you're done, you will be able to read the following secret message:\n",

    "   \n",
    "Note that since English has 26 characters, your ROT-13 program will be able to both encode and decode texts written in English.\n",

    "\"99 Bottles of Beer\" is a traditional song in the United States and Canada. It is popular to sing on long trips, as it has a very repetitive format which is easy to memorize, and can take a long time to sing. The song's simple lyrics are as follows:\n",

    "99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.\n",
    "Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.\n",

    "Here's a simple real-world application from the ever-growing field of Bioinformatics. Genetic information is stored in DNA, which is a sequence of 4 bases (the nucleotides, conventionally indicated by the uppercase letters A, C, T, G). Thus a part of a gene might look like the string [\"GATTACA\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gattaca). During [translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)), molecular machinery converts the genetic sequence to a string of aminoacids constituting a protein (proteins are the building blocks of our bodies). In particular, DNA is read as a sequence of three-letter long \"words\" (the *codons*), each of which identifies an aminoacid. Aminoacids are also written as uppercase alphabet letters. So a sequence like \"ATACAACCTGGTTCA\" would be segmented as \"(ATA)(CAA)(CCT)(GGT)(TCA)\" and translated to \"IQPGS\", according to the [standard genetic code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_codon_table) (see also the dictionary below). In reality, these sequences are a few thousand characters long, hence the need for Bioinformaticians to crunch them. Happily, if we discard all the chemistry, this is just straightforward string processing. \n",

    "Write a program that asks the user for a nucleotide sequence and translates it into aminoacids. Use the genetic code table given below as a dictionary to look up the codons and perform the translation."
